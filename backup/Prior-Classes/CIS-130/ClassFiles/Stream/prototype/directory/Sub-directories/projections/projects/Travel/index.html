After hiking on the mountain trails for a couple of hours we found a hot spring and decided to jump in! It was really refreshing and revitalising! At night the stars can be seen crystal clear from the cliff side! The trip was exuberant!"

The calm relaxed atmosphere really gets to you! And if you're a gambling man, there's always something to do! In fact, my favorite event is the chocobo races!"
